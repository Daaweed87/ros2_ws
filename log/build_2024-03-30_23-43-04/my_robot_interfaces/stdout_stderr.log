[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findadd_two_ints.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "add_two_ints", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "add_two_ints" with
  any of the following names:

    add_two_intsConfig.cmake
    add_two_ints-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "add_two_ints" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "add_two_ints_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "add_two_ints" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
